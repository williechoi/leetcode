# Leetcode Problems

Here is a collection of codes that I wrote in preparation for **coding tests**    
Each folder contains a leetcode problem and its solution.  
Please note that there are some incomplete solutions, but most problems contain solutions.     
When tackling leetcode problems, I try to write codes with my own thoughts and logics,   
but some solutions may refer to the book [Python Algorithm Interview](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791189909178)(written by Sanggil Park)
