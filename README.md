# Leetcode Problems
---------
Preparation for *coding tests*
Each folder represents a leetcode problem and its solution.
Please note that there are some incomplete solutions. 
When tackling leetcode problems, I try to write codes with my own thoughts and logics, 
but some solutions may refer to the book `Python Algorithm Interview`, written by Sanggil Park.
