# Leetcode Problems
---------
Preparation for *coding tests*
<br/>
Each folder represents a leetcode problem and its solution.  
Please note that there are some incomplete solutions.   
When tackling leetcode problems, I try to write codes with my own thoughts and logics,   
but some solutions may refer to the book `Python Algorithm Interview`(http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791189909178), written by Sanggil Park.
